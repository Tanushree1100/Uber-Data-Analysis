# Uber-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to leverage the power of data analytics to gain insights from Uber trip data, utilizing a combination of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, Python programming, and modern data pipeline tools. The project involves end-to-end data processing, from raw data ingestion to insightful visualization.

The main goal is to analyze taxi trip records from New York City's TLC (Taxi & Limousine Commission) data, which includes information such as pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, fares, and passenger counts. By processing and analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in urban transportation.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**: Raw data is ingested from the source and stored securely in Google Cloud Storage.
2. **Data Processing and Transformation**: Python scripts running on GCP Compute Instances are used to clean, process, and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis.
3. **Data Pipelines**: Automated data pipelines are built using Mage to streamline the data flow from ingestion to analysis.
4. **Data Analysis**: BigQuery is employed to perform complex queries and analyze large datasets efficiently.
5. **Data Visualization**: Looker Studio is used to create interactive dashboards and reports that provide actionable insights from the data.

This project is designed to be scalable and can be adapted for different datasets or extended with additional features, such as machine learning models or real-time data processing. It also serves as a practical example of how to build a modern data analytics solution using cloud-based technologies and open-source tools.
